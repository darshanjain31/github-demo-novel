Nick visits his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom Buchanan, who live in East Egg. The Buchanans' mansion is grand and opulent.
Daisy is charming and beautiful but seems somewhat sad and restless. Tom is described as a physically powerful, aggressive man with racist and elitist views.
At dinner, Tom introduces a topic from a racist book he’s been reading, which makes Nick uncomfortable.
They are joined by Jordan Baker, a professional golfer and friend of Daisy. Jordan is aloof and sophisticated.
Hints of Complexity:

During dinner, Tom receives a phone call, and it becomes apparent that he is having an affair. This creates a tense atmosphere.
Daisy confides in Nick about her discontent with her life and her cynical outlook, hinting at deeper troubles beneath her carefree facade.
Jordan mentions to Nick that Tom has a mistress in New York, further exposing the cracks in the Buchanans' marriage.
Catsby's Introduction:

Nick returns home and reflects on his evening. He notes that, despite the Buchanan's wealth and social standing, there is an underlying sense of dissatisfaction and moral decay.
The chapter ends with Nick seeing his mysterious neighbor, Jay Catsby, for the first time. Catsby stands on the lawn, staring at the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock across the bay. This green light becomes a significant symbol throughout the novel.
Themes Introduced
The American Dream: The juxtaposition between West Egg (new money) and East Egg (old money) introduces the theme of social class and the pursuit of the American Dream.
Morality and Decay: Despite their wealth, the Buchanans’ lives are marked by infidelity and moral emptiness.
Isolation and Longing: Catsby’s solitary figure staring at the green light symbolizes his longing and the elusive nature of his dreams.
This chapter effectively sets up the primary characters and themes, hinting at the conflicts and complexities that will unfold as the 
story progresses.

Nick rents a modest house in West Egg, a fictional area on Long Island. West Egg is known for its inhabitants who have recently acquired wealth, in contrast to East Egg, which is home to the established aristocracy. 
The distinction between the two areas highlights the novel's exploration of social class and the differences between "new money" and 
"old money."
