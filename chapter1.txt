In Chapter 1 of "The Great Gatsby," the stage is set for the novel’s exploration of the American Dream, wealth, and social dynamics in the Jazz Age. Here’s a detailed summary of the first chapter:

Summary of Chapter 1
Narrator Introduction:

The story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a young man from a prominent family in the Midwest. He introduces himself and mentions his father's advice about reserving judgment, which has allowed him to understand various perspectives.
Nick graduated from Yale, fought in World War I, and then moved to New York in the summer of 1922 to learn about the bond business.
Setting:

Nick lives in West Egg, a fictional place on Long Island, known for its newly rich residents. His modest house is nestled between the mansions.
Across the bay lies East Egg, inhabited by the old aristocracy and those with established wealth.
The Buchanans:

Nick visits his cousin, Daisy Buchanan, and her husband, Tom Buchanan, who live in East Egg. The Buchanans' mansion is grand and opulent.
Daisy is charming and beautiful but seems somewhat sad and restless. Tom is described as a physically powerful, aggressive man with racist and elitist views.
At dinner, Tom introduces a topic from a racist book he’s been reading, which makes Nick uncomfortable.
They are joined by Jordan Baker, a professional golfer and friend of Daisy. Jordan is aloof and sophisticated.
Hints of Complexity:

During dinner, Tom receives a phone call, and it becomes apparent that he is having an affair. This creates a tense atmosphere.
Daisy confides in Nick about her discontent with her life and her cynical outlook, hinting at deeper troubles beneath her carefree facade.
Jordan mentions to Nick that Tom has a mistress in New York, further exposing the cracks in the Buchanans' marriage.
Gatsby's Introduction:

Nick returns home and reflects on his evening. He notes that, despite the Buchanan's wealth and social standing, there is an underlying sense of dissatisfaction and moral decay.
The chapter ends with Nick seeing his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby, for the first time. Gatsby stands on the lawn, staring at the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock across the bay. This green light becomes a significant symbol throughout the novel.
